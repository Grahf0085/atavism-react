          <li>Max Level of 50 and very little ROZ/COP until Shadow Lord is Vanquished</li>
          <li>Land Kings are Force Pop</li>
          <li>Dia/Bio Overwrite Works Both Ways</li>
          <li>No Dual Boxing At This Time</li>
          <li>No Limit on Number of Auction House Listings. Items expire in 30 days.</li>
          <li>Level Sync: 10</li>
          <li>Mob Trains Walk back to Spawn Point instead of Despawning</li>
          <li>Craft Skillup Rate: 1.5</li>
          <li>No Global Yell</li>
          <li>Several Jobs H2H skill drastically increased in-order-to make Monk a more viable subjob</li>
          <li>PLD and DRK MP increased to equal RDMs. This is the way PLD and DRK were before the US release. Reintroduced here for
          many reasons including helping with a lack of healers and creating new opportunities for job/subjob combinations
          </li>
          <li>It&apos;s a known bug that topaz has way too many mobs in some zones. Also, SE has moved mobs around and
          introduced new mobs over the years. I attempted to rearrange a few zones and then got tired of it.
